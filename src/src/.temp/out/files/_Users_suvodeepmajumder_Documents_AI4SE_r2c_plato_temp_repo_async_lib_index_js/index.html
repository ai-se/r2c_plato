 * An &quot;async function&quot; in the context of Async is an asynchronous function with
 * a variable number of parameters, with the final parameter being a callback.
 * (`function (arg1, arg2, ..., callback) {}`)
 * The final callback is of the form `callback(err, results...)`, which must be
 * called once the function is completed.  The callback should be called with a
 * Error as its first argument to signal that an error occurred.
 * Otherwise, if no error occurred, it should be called with `null` as the first
 * argument, and any additional `result` arguments that may apply, to signal
 * successful completion.
 * The callback must be called exactly once, ideally on a later tick of the
 * JavaScript event loop.
 *
 * This type of function is also referred to as a &quot;Node-style async function&quot;,
 * or a &quot;continuation passing-style function&quot; (CPS). Most of the methods of this
 * library are themselves CPS/Node-style async functions, or functions that
 * return CPS/Node-style async functions.
 *
 * Wherever we accept a Node-style async function, we also directly accept an
 * [ES2017 `async` function]{@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function}.
 * In this case, the `async` function will not be passed a final callback
 * argument, and any thrown error will be used as the `err` argument of the
 * implicit callback, and the return value will be used as the `result` value.
 * (i.e. a `rejected` of the returned Promise becomes the `err` callback
 * argument, and a `resolved` value becomes the `result`.)
 *
 * Note, due to JavaScript limitations, we can only detect native `async`
 * functions and not transpilied implementations.
 * Your environment must have `async`/`await` support for this to work.
 * (e.g. Node &gt; v7.6, or a recent version of a modern browser).
 * If you are using `async` functions through a transpiler (e.g. Babel), you
 * must still wrap the function with [asyncify]{@link module:Utils.asyncify},
 * because the `async function` will be compiled to an ordinary function that
 * returns a promise.
 *
 * @typedef {Function} AsyncFunction
